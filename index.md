### Personal Projects

[Final Year Project](https://github.com/Liamplussquared/final-year-project)

I was responsible for creating infrastcture that would aid in story generation. My work focuses on identifying & measuring relations between words, sorting a list of words in a manner that would constitute a "good" story, and generating meaningful sentences between words.
